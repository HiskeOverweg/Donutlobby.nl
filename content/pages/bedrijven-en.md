Our planet isn't doing great. And that is an understatement. If we don't act today, we will be in trouble tomorrow. If we continue with business as usual, the temperature at the end of the century will be more than three degrees higher than prior to the industrial revolution. This will have big consequences for all life on earth.

A lot has to happen to make our planet future-proof. One of the most important issues is the reduction of greenhouse gas emission. But how do we realize this? And what is the impact of different measures?

What is the effect of planting extra trees? Is it useful to build more nuclear power plants? Should we focus on insulating buildings? Those are a couple of questions we need to answer.



Fortunately we can already look at the impact of these measures. You're asking how? In the UN Climate Action Summit we do this with the En-ROADS climate simulator, based on science and focused on action.


### UN Climate Action Summit

Envisioning how to keep the earth liveable with a maximum of 36 participants. The format in which we will work is inspired by the UN. During the session participants represent different stakeholders: the fossil fuel industry, farmers, climate activists, the clean technology sector, world leaders and the industry and commerce sector. Guided by the UN Secretary General these groups will propose measures to reach the goal of the Paris agreement: to limit global warming to a maximum of 2°C and ideally as close as possible to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

We use the En-ROADS climate simulator, which allows participants to see the impact of the proposed measures at the touch of a button. Scientific evidence shows that participating in the UN Climate Action Summit enlarges climate knowledge and willingness to take action of participants.


### Target audiences

*	SMEs willing to create support for a faster reduction of emissions

*	Corporates willing to start a program to accelerate emission reductions

*	Government institutions willing to drive change

*	Educational institutions looking to make their school future proof
