### About me

Living consciously, that's what it's all about for me.

Doing things you believe in and sharing that with those around you. Both on a large and small scale. Out of respect for all life around us.

Making a positive contribution to the world, that's what I'm committed to.

Whether by giving a concert with an ensemble in a elderly home, tutoring an elementary school student who has trouble reading or using [my knowledge and experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hiske-overweg/) to convince people that it is time to act and save the planet.

A thinker who does and a doer who thinks with a touch of humor if possible.

My mission: to show people how rewarding it can be to work together on a future-proof planet.


### Donuts?

The donut in question is the [donut](https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/) from the Doughnut Economy by [Kate Raworth](https://www.kateraworth.com/), an economic model in which ecological boundaries are respected (the outer edge) while at the same time ensuring everyone's primary necessity is fullfilled (the inner edge).
