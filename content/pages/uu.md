Can you align the perspectives of farmers, climate activists, industry and politicians in this interactive simulation game?

This role-playing experience offers insights into the perspectives of key stakeholders in the climate debate. As a farmer, oil magnate, activist or politician, you are invite to a special UN climate summit to secure the goals of the Paris Agreement. You propose solutions which will be tested with the En-ROADS climate simulator, developed by scientists from MIT.

How much environmental benifit does abolishing fossil fuel subsidies bring? What happens if innovations in agriculture are left to the market? Armed with this information, you negotiate with other stakeholders and defend the interests of your sector to meet the targets from the Paris Agreement.

For those interested, we can discuss options to learn how to facilitate this workshop yourself at the end of the session.
